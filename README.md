Our app is mainly designed to record the initial doctor/patient assessment and help with History (Hx) and Physical Exam (Px) sections (black text)
The red text in the Physical Exam (PE) are the parts that are changed/different from the normal negative template
If in the recorded conversation, the doctor comments on any abnormal findings, then the program needs to add it to the physical examination section, and delete any contradictory statement. So for example the template by default says “abdomen is soft and non-tender”. If the doctor in the conversation says “the abdomen is tender at the right lower quadrant” then the program needs to write “abdomen is soft and tender at the right lower quadrant” instead. If the doctor doesn’t say anything, then just insert the normal negative template. 
This doesn’t have to be perfect - the doctor may forget to say it (sometimes I just think it and don’t say it out loud) - I can always just edit the physical exam section after. The biggest/most important use for me, is recording the history portion (Hx) of the conversation.
If the patient audio has any personal details (name/address), make sure the final document does not include it. 
The transcripts below were generated by iPhone voice memos app when I was recording it, it’s pretty good already, but some medical words it messes up. Is there a way to make sure our app has a “medical vocabulary library” downloaded?
